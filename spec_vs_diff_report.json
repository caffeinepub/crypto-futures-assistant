  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/public/service-worker.js to implement the required network-passthrough logic for external API domains. When the device is online (navigator.onLine === true), the service worker returns early without intercepting API calls. When offline, it returns a 503 JSON error. App-shell caching logic remains unchanged. All REQ-12 acceptance criteria appear to be addressed by the implementation.",
